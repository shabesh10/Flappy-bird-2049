# FLAPPY BIRD: 2049

## Description: 
This project is a simple clone of the Flappy Bird game built using java swing with some changes and additions. This game replicates the original gameplay mechanics, including the iconic pipe obstacles.

## Features
- Smooth, physics-based gameplay
- Procedurally generated pipe obstacles
- Customizable bird and background themes
- Sound effects and score tracking


## Technical Details
1. Platform:
   - Developed in Java using Swing and AWT libraries for GUI rendering.
   - Supports cross-platform execution.

2. Design Patterns:
   - Object-Oriented Approach: Separate classes for `Bird` and `Pipe` encapsulate game object properties and behavior.
   - Timer-based Game Loop: Ensures smooth gameplay at 60 frames per second.

3. Collision Detection:
   - Pixel-perfect bounding box collision detection ensures accurate gameplay interactions.

4. Dynamic Difficulty:
   - Pipes are placed at random heights, with varying gaps to maintain a challenging yet engaging experience.

5. Error Handling:
   - Exception handling ensures smooth loading of assets such as images and audio files.

6. Expandable Design:
   - Easily extendable for new features like additional levels, power-ups, or multiplayer modes.


## **Gameplay Instructions**  
### How to Play
1. Press [Spacebar] to make the bird flap.
2. Avoid hitting the pipes and the ground.
3. Score points by passing through the gaps in the pipes.
